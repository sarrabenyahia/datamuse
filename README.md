# Datamuse : What to do in Paris ? 

<br>

## About the Project
The following project is realized as part of the Linux course given by the MoSEF Master at the University of Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne. The main goal is to deploy an app with Docker or with a simple shell file. We have decided to backend the application with a NLP model based on TF-IDF to make recommendations from opendata.paris.fr

In this repository, you will find the following elements:
* A canva presentation 'Datamuse' to explain the purpose of our project. 
* A webapp folder and an app_docker folder

## Problematic

After spending several days in Paris or living permanently in Paris, you have already visited all the museums. What activity can I do? Less known museums, concerts, shows... Write what you want and we will advise you!

The project is built in two parts. 
<br>


<!-- Console Application -->
## Console Application:
The first part is the console version of the final application, our "beta-application" if you want. This version of the application takes into account two arguments : the data as a csv file, and the keyword that serves as your research (for example, Louvre, Op√©ra, or even Picasso) to let the recommendation system find the most similar events to suggest to the user.

### Installation and launching of the console application:

1. Clone the repository
```sh
https://github.com/sarrabenyahia/datamuse.git
```
2. Change your current working directory
```sh
cd app_docker
```
3. Install required dependencies
```sh
source install.sh
```
3. Launch the application with the keyword of your choice (keep in mind to translate your searches in french üá´üá∑ for example : Louvre)
```sh
bash launch.sh [keyword]
```

<!-- WEB APP -->
## Web application
Our Webapp allows users to receive recommendations using NLP and similarity computing with the TF-IDF cosine similarity matrix.
The app is hosted on the local machine at http://localhost:8000/.

The main page, or "Home", is just a simple user guide for the app!
After mastering the console application and having dockerized it, we challenged ourselves by creating a web application using the django package.

- Created Django form with the research key-word to be entered
- Created views for index page and prediction page. The predict view inputs the key-word as values to the NLP model. (File: webapp/linux_app/views.py)
- The model outputs the label index of the recommended cultural events. The title and other information of the events recommended are fetched from the api downloaded file of https://opendata.paris.fr/ (File: data.csv).
- An HTML page is rendered with that serves as a home page to explain the purpose of the project to the user (File: webapp/linux_app/templates/result.html)
- An HTML page is rendered with the form and the recommended events. (File: webapp/linux_app/templates/result.html)

### Installation and launching of the django webapp

1. Clone the repository
```sh
https://github.com/sarrabenyahia/datamuse.git
```
2. Change your current working directory
```sh
cd webapp
```
3. Install required dependencies 
```sh
source install.sh
```
3. Launch the application with the keyword of your choice (keep in mind to translate your searches in french üá´üá∑ for example : Louvre)
```sh
bash launch.sh [keyword]
```

### Access to our app:

* Django Web App: http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Note
* Our Web App is ready for deployement in a web server but a .env file with manage.py : debug and secret_key must be created to maintain a certain security level.
* Our presentation on [canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFVY1C0EO4/q6OMxjwykrttN0HMmBHwcA/view?utm_content=DAFVY1C0EO4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
